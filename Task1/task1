Task 1 - Iris Flower Classification 

The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each species is distinguished by various measurements. The objective is to train a machine learning model to classify iris flowers based on these measurements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Task Description
Given the measurements of iris flowers, your task is to build and train a machine learning model that can accurately classify the species of the iris flowers. The dataset includes the following measurements for each flower:

=> Sepal Length
=> Sepal Width
=> Petal Length
=> Petal Width

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Steps Performed: 
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
=> Load the Iris dataset.
=> Inspect the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
=> Handle any missing or inconsistent data.

2. Data Splitting
=> Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

3. Feature Scaling
=> Apply feature scaling if necessary to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model's performance.

4. Model Training
=> Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest).
=> Train the model on the training data.

5. Model Evaluation
=> Evaluate the model using the testing set.
=> Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.

6. Results
=> Present the results and findings from the model evaluation.
