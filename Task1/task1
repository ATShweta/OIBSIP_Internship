Task 1 - Iris Flower Classification 

The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each species is distinguished by various measurements. The objective is to train a machine learning model to classify iris flowers based on these measurements.

Task Description
Given the measurements of iris flowers, your task is to build and train a machine learning model that can accurately classify the species of the iris flowers. The dataset includes the following measurements for each flower:

<li>Sepal Length
<li>Sepal Width
<li>Petal Length
<li>Petal Width

<hr>
Steps Performed: 
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
<li>Load the Iris dataset.
<li>Inspect the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
<li>Handle any missing or inconsistent data.

2. Data Splitting
<li>Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

3. Feature Scaling
<li>Apply feature scaling if necessary to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model's performance.

4. Model Training
<li>Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest).
<li>Train the model on the training data.

5. Model Evaluation
<li>Evaluate the model using the testing set.
<li>Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.

6. Results
<li>Present the results and findings from the model evaluation.
