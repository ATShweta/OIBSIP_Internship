Task - Sales Prediction Using Python

Description - 
In this task, the goal is to predict future sales based on various advertising efforts using machine learning techniques. 
Sales prediction is a critical activity for businesses, as it helps them optimize their advertising budgets, target the right customer segments, and choose the most effective 
platforms for their marketing campaigns. By analyzing historical data, we aim to build a predictive model that can estimate the impact of advertising spend on sales figures.

This task involves:
- Understanding and preprocessing the sales dataset, which includes columns such as 'TV', 'Radio', and 'Newspaper' advertising budgets, as well as corresponding 'Sales' figures.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns and insights from the data.
- Applying machine learning algorithms to develop a sales prediction model that can accurately forecast future sales based on advertising spend.
- Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

The task serves as a practical demonstration of how businesses can leverage data-driven strategies to enhance decision-making and improve sales outcomes.
